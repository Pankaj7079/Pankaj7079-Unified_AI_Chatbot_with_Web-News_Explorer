**Your all-in-one AI companion for smart conversations, real-time web search, and the latest AI news.**

## Overview

This project is a **unified AI chatbot** that combines the best of conversational AI, web exploration, and AI news updates.

Unlike a simple chatbot, this system uses multiple **state-of-the-art language models (LLMs)**, integrates real-time web search, and fetches up-to-date AI news â€” all inside one clean and interactive app.

Built with **LangGraph** for agent-based workflows and a sleek **Streamlit UI**, itâ€™s designed to be both powerful and easy to use. Whether you want a casual conversation, the latest news on AI breakthroughs, or to search for specific information online, this chatbot has you covered.
